[Making Use of Big Data Now](http://bit.ly/10ADake) | Sandro Saitta  
[Mark Zielinski](https://twitter.com/MarkMRtech) talks about how big data can help us answer the 'why' i.e. explain the trends and underlying reasons behind the results that have been achieved. He goes on to suggest that organisations need to go out and hire a developer to help them analyse their data rather than wait for an out the box solution to appear which everyone will be using.

[Analyzing Logs and More - a Big Data Architecture](http://bit.ly/TqQtzu) | Sri Desikan  
We have unstructured log files all over the place potentially containing useful information if we could mine it effectively. Suggestions here include storing the data it in [HBase](http://hbase.apache.org/) or [Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/), making it searchable using [Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/) or [Lucene](http://lucene.apache.org/core/) and then setting up reporting using queries that answer business questions.

[Sure, Big Data Is Great. But So Is Intuition.](http://nyti.ms/WT95YH) | Steve Lohr  
Steve Lohr talks about the benefits of big data but suggests using our intuition too since "what is intuition at its best  but large amounts of data of all kinds filtered through a human brain rather than a math model?". Larry Ferlazzo refers to this as being being ['data informed' rather than 'data driven'](http://bit.ly/VpV0mL)
