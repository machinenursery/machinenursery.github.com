## Visualisation

###[gephi](https://gephi.org/) - The Open Viz Platform  
gephi is a client side application which is useful for exploring networks/graphs and coming up with visualisations around those. We used it to create a visualisation of a [neo4j](http://bit.ly/TpSImX) graph showing the [connections between different sponsors](http://bit.ly/W8k8dK) at [ThoughtWorks](http://bit.ly/WRzndK).
